NEAT_TEST_INVALID = Conn innovations not set when created, thus it created definitely too much connections. Chances of
structure mutation at 10%, definitely too big as it evolved like 160 hidden neurons. Prefer smaller networks, set connInn
properly.



NEAT_3 = Final version. Speciefication included. This should be final version to compare.
