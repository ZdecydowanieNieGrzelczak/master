NEAT_TEST_INVALID = Conn innovations not set when created, thus it created definitely too much connections. Chances of
structure mutation at 10%, definitely too big as it evolved like 160 hidden neurons. Prefer smaller networks, set connInn
properly.



NEAT_3 = Final version. Speciefication included. This should be final version to compare.
WEIGHTS_MUTATION_RATE 75
CONN_TOGGLING_RATE 12
STRUCTURE_MUTATION_RATE 4


SIMPLER_NEAT = STILL NEAT. wrong name, it was running standard neat

CORRECT_SIMPLER_0 = NEAT without prunning, so actually probably the same stuff as regular neat.
